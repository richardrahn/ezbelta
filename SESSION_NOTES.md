## Key Decisions Made:

### Immediate (YouTube Content Creation):
- **Platform:** HeyGen Creator ($24/month) - unlimited videos, best value
- **Why:** Unlimited videos, excellent lip-sync, video translation, 4K export
- **Expected Impact:** 4x content output (2-4 videos/week vs 1 every 2-3 weeks)
- **Time Savings:** 75% reduction (2-4 hours per video vs 8-16 hours)
- **Next Step:** Sign up for free trial, create 2-3 test videos

### Strategic (Ezbelta Content Studio Product):
- **Decision:** YES, pursue it - but with phased validation approach
- **Approach:** Hybrid (start with API partnership, build custom if validated)
- **Phase 1 Investment:** $30K-$75K over 6 months
- **Phase 1 Goal:** Validate with existing Ezbelta customers, achieve $10K-$20K MRR
- **Success Metric:** If ≥$20K MRR at Month 6, proceed to Phase 2 (scale)
- **Market Gap:** No vertical platform exists for lean manufacturing training
- **Differentiation:** Manufacturing-specific templates, lean terminology, SOPs, factory avatars
